# Regex FSM

Lab: Finite State Machine for Regular Expressions  

## Goal

Implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) that recognizes input strings based on simple regular expressions.

## Supported Regex Features

- `a`, `b`, ... â€” exact character match
- `.` â€” any single character
- `*` â€” zero or more repetitions
- `+` â€” one or more repetitions
- `[a-z0-9]` â€” character classes

## Project Structure

- `regex.py` â€” main module containing state classes and the FSM builder
- `tests.py` â€” script for testing FSM functionality

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python3 regex.py
```
